# Couchbase Agent Operations Manager

<img width="3456" height="2098" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec71859-ce6b-4482-94e9-ec72525286fb" />

A Dockerized appliance that uses **Couchbase as a centralized, secure MCP
tool database and LLM Caching Service**: MCP tool definitions are embedded and stored in Couchbase,
and access to them is controlled with **RBAC combined with Couchbase Vector
Search pre-filtering** - a single Search (FTS) request that narrows the
candidate tool set by role and trust status *before/alongside* ranking by
semantic similarity, not after.

SDK and Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini skills included under Tools that can build a new agent with the SDK connected to the deployment or use Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini to configure your existing agent(s) for use.

## The problem this solves

Most MCP-using agents today treat every configured MCP server, and every
tool it advertises, as trusted by default. There is usually no login, no
per-tool authorization, and no record of who called what. That default
model creates three well-known failure modes:

- **Unauthorized local code execution** - a tool from an unreviewed server
  gets run just because the agent was pointed at it.
- **Hidden prompt injection** - a tool's *description* (not its output) can
  carry instructions the LLM treats as trusted system text, because
  nothing distinguishes "text from a vetted source" from "text from
  anywhere."
- **Over-privileged access** - any caller can invoke any tool on any
  configured server, including destructive admin actions, because nothing
  ties a request to who is actually asking.

The Couchbase Agent Operations Manager sits between your agents and the world
of MCP tool servers and closes all three: agents never talk to a downstream
MCP server directly. They authenticate to this appliance, ask it to *discover*
tools for a task (RBAC + vector-search pre-filter, never a full unfiltered
tool dump), and ask it to *invoke* whichever tool they picked - re-checked
against Couchbase independently before anything is proxied downstream. Every
decision is written to an append-only audit log.

It also runs a dedicated **MCP Tool Hijacking detector** (see
[MCP Tool Hijacking detection](#mcp-tool-hijacking-detection) below) - the
indirect-prompt-injection variant where a malicious tool description or
response tries to steer the agent's next action, up to and including
calling a completely different, higher-privilege tool. RBAC and trust
review stop an *unregistered* tool from ever being reachable; hijacking
detection is what catches a *registered, reviewed* tool whose description
or live output has been poisoned.

The same "one governed choke point" argument applies to the *other* half of
an agent's traffic - its model calls - which is what **[LLM caching for
agents](#llm-caching-for-agents)** adds: agents route completions through
`/v1/llm/complete` against Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini, answers are cached in
Couchbase by exact hash and by vector similarity, and the tokens a repeat
question would have cost are never spent. Cache invalidation is policy, not
guesswork - TTL, reuse limits, model/policy/catalog change detection, scope
and namespace, never-cache rules and manual purge - and a dashboard reports
what the caching actually saved.

Five containers:

- **couchbase** - Couchbase Server, Enterprise Edition. Required (not a
  preference): the vector-typed index field this appliance's core feature
  depends on is rejected outright by Community Edition. Free to run for
  development/testing under Couchbase's standard license.
- **couchbase-init** - one-shot provisioning: bucket/scope/collections
  (`servers`, `tools`, `identities`, `access_log`, `llm_cache`,
  `llm_cache_log`, `settings`) and primary indexes.
- **sample-mcp-servers** - six bundled mock MCP tool servers so the
  appliance is testable immediately, no real credentials needed: `jira`,
  `zendesk`, `snowflake` (well-behaved), `docs-search` and `web-search`
  (MCP Tool Hijacking fixtures - see below), and `shadow-diagnostics` (an
  intentionally unregistered server). Remove this container whenever you
  no longer need the samples.
- **operations-manager** - the appliance itself. Authenticates callers, ingests
  only explicitly-registered/trusted servers' tool catalogs into Couchbase
  with embeddings + `allowed_roles` + `trust_status`, answers discovery
  requests with one Couchbase Search request combining vector kNN with an
  RBAC/trust pre-filter, re-checks authorization before proxying any
  invoke, and writes an audit-log entry for every decision. Also runs the
  MCP Tool Hijacking detector: a metadata scan at ingest time, a response
  scan on every invoke, and a background monitor that re-scans the catalog
  on a timer. Finally, it is the LLM caching gateway - see [LLM caching for
  agents](#llm-caching-for-agents).
- **ui** - the admin dashboard (React + TypeScript + Vite, served by nginx): a
  live findings/insights feed, server registration, the tool catalog, roles,
  the audit log, and an Agent Tool Audit for calling discover/invoke directly.

## RBAC model

Three seed roles, each with its own API key (see `.env.example`):

- `support_agent` - Jira (read) + Zendesk (read/write)
- `finance_analyst` - Snowflake read-only analytics
- `admin` - everything trusted, including the two high-risk Snowflake admin
  tools (`manage_users`, `manage_warehouse`)

Roles themselves are reviewable, code-owned config in
`operations-manager/app/rbac_policy.py` - they're the kind of thing a security
team reviews in a PR, not something added through a UI. **Servers**,
though, are meant to change without a redeploy: register new ones from the
Servers page (or `POST /v1/servers`) and their tools get ingested with a
deny-by-default policy (admin-only, `risk_level: unclassified`) unless you
assign default allowed roles at registration time, or add a reviewed
override to `TOOL_POLICY`. Couchbase's `tools` collection - not the Python
file - is the actual runtime source of truth the operations manager queries on
every request.

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # optional - defaults work out of the box
docker compose up --build
```

or, for a clearer view of the multi-container startup sequence:

```bash
./start.sh
```

> **On a corporate laptop behind a TLS-inspecting proxy** (Zscaler, Netskope,
> Palo Alto GlobalProtect, etc.), `pip install`/`npm install` inside the build
> containers will fail with a self-signed-certificate error unless they trust
> your org's proxy CA. Run this once first:
>
> ```bash
> ./scripts/setup-corporate-ca.sh
> ```
>
> It exports the CA(s) your Mac already trusts into `certs/` (gitignored,
> machine-specific) so the Docker builds - and the operations-manager
> container's embedding-model download at startup - can trust them too.

First boot downloads the Couchbase Enterprise image and a local embedding
model (~100MB, cached afterwards) - give it a few minutes. Then open:

- **Dashboard**: <https://localhost> (log in as `admin` - you'll be
  asked to set that account's password the first time)
- **Operations Manager API**: <https://localhost:8090> (see `/docs` for the
  OpenAPI UI)
- **Couchbase Web Console**: <http://localhost:8091> (`Administrator` /
  `CouchbaseDemo123!` by default - Couchbase Server's own console isn't
  covered by this appliance's TLS setup)

Both the dashboard and the API serve HTTPS with a self-signed certificate
by default, so your browser will warn about it and `curl`/SDK calls need
`-k`/`verify=False` until you install a real one - see
[HTTPS / TLS](#https--tls) below.

LLM caching is on by default and needs no API key to try - see
[LLM caching for agents](#llm-caching-for-agents).

`docker compose down -v` gives you a fully clean start (drops the
Couchbase and embedding-model-cache volumes).

**Running this on Kubernetes instead?** See
[helm/couchbase-agent-operations-manager](./helm/couchbase-agent-operations-manager)
for a Helm chart covering the same five-piece topology (Couchbase as a
StatefulSet, provisioning as a Job instead of docker-compose.yml's
always-on init container, the sample MCP servers, operations-manager, and
the dashboard) - read that chart's README first, in particular "Before you
install": the three custom images have to be built and pushed to a
registry your cluster can reach before `helm install` will do anything but
ImagePullBackOff.

## HTTPS / TLS

The dashboard (nginx, published on the standard HTTPS port 443) and the Operations Manager API
(uvicorn, port 8090) both serve HTTPS by default, including the internal
proxy hop nginx makes to the API. Each image bakes in a self-signed
certificate at build time (`operations-manager/Dockerfile`,
`ui/Dockerfile`) so a fresh checkout gets TLS with zero configuration -
your browser will warn about the self-signed cert, and `curl`/SDK calls
need `-k` / `verify=False` (see the [Developer SDK](#developer-sdk)
section) until you swap in a real one.

**Using your own certificate - Settings page (recommended).** Log in as an
admin and open Settings → HTTPS Certificate: paste or upload a PEM
certificate (a leaf cert, or a leaf + intermediate chain concatenated) and
its matching unencrypted private key, validate the pair, then install.
This writes straight into `tls-shared`, a Docker volume shared by both
`operations-manager` and `ui` (see `docker-compose.yml`) - one upload
covers the dashboard and the API. Neither server hot-reloads a changed
certificate, so restart both afterward:

```bash
docker compose restart operations-manager ui
```

The page also shows the certificate currently in use (subject, issuer,
validity, and whether it's still the self-signed default) and can revert
back to that default if needed.

**Using your own certificate - bind mount (alternative).** If you'd rather
manage the files yourself instead of using the Settings page, drop a
`server.crt`/`server.key` pair into `operations-manager/tls/` and
`ui/tls/` (both are gitignored - never commit private keys), then in
`docker-compose.yml` comment out each service's `tls-shared:` volume line
and uncomment the bind-mount line right below it:

```yaml
# operations-manager service
volumes:
  - ./operations-manager/tls:/app/tls:ro

# ui service
volumes:
  - ./ui/tls:/etc/nginx/tls:ro
```

Only one mount can occupy each of those paths, so don't leave both
uncommented. Restart with `docker compose up --build` and both containers
pick up the mounted cert instead of the shared volume's - no other
configuration changes.

**Disabling TLS.** If you need plain HTTP (e.g. running behind a load
balancer that already terminates TLS), set `DISABLE_TLS=true` for
`operations-manager` and `OPERATIONS_MANAGER_SCHEME=http` for `ui` in your
`.env`, so nginx's proxy hop matches the API's actual scheme. The two
settings must agree, or nginx will fail to reach the API.

**Corporate CA for LDAP.** This is unrelated to the two settings above.
If you connect Settings → LDAP Authentication to a directory whose LDAPS
certificate (or StartTLS cert) is signed by an internal corporate CA, use
the "Install corporate CA certificate" option on that page to upload the
CA's PEM so the appliance can validate the LDAP server's certificate. This
is also unrelated to `scripts/setup-corporate-ca.sh`, which is a
build-time-only helper for trusting a TLS-inspecting proxy CA during
`docker compose build` (see the note under [Run it](#run-it)).

## Security Hardening

Beyond HTTPS/TLS, this repository has been hardened against a set of
industry security baselines: CIS Benchmarks, NIST SP 800-53 / SP 800-123,
DISA STIG control objectives, and PCI DSS v4.0. That work spans the
FastAPI backend (CORS lockdown, security response headers, a 12-character
password policy, login lockout after repeated failed attempts, auth
audit logging, default-credential warnings), the Docker Compose stack
(non-root containers, dropped Linux capabilities, `no-new-privileges`,
Couchbase's admin/data ports and the sample MCP servers bound to
localhost only), and nginx (a hardened TLS cipher suite, `server_tokens
off`, and the same security headers on the dashboard).

See [SECURITY_HARDENING.md](./SECURITY_HARDENING.md) for the full
change-by-change writeup, the specific standard/requirement each change
addresses, what was reviewed and already found compliant, and - just as
important - the gaps that remain (MFA for dashboard login and password
history are the two biggest) along with why they're not silently glossed
over.

## Using the dashboard

- **Dashboard** - stat cards (open findings, registered/trusted servers,
  tools ingested, access events), an access-volume chart, an allow/deny/
  error donut, and the highest-severity open findings.
- **MCP Servers** - the registered server list; register a new one (server
  ID, label, owner, MCP URL, trust status, default allowed roles) and its
  catalog is ingested immediately; re-ingest or unregister existing ones.
- **Tool Catalog** - every tool actually stored in Couchbase's registry,
  filterable by server/role - the full transparency view of what
  discovery can ever return.
- **Roles & RBAC** - the three seed roles and how many tools each can
  reach. API keys live in environment variables, never in the UI or API
  responses - only a masked `...last4` label is ever shown.
- **Threat Detection** - the MCP Tool Hijacking surface: quarantined tools
  with their matched signals and a one-click Release action, recently
  flagged live responses, cross-tool hijack chain findings, and the last
  background scan time. See [MCP Tool Hijacking
  detection](#mcp-tool-hijacking-detection) below.
- **Insights** - findings derived from the current catalog, server
  registry, and recent audit log: quarantined tools, cross-tool hijack
  chains, unclassified tools defaulting to admin-only, trusted servers
  with an empty catalog, repeated invalid API key attempts, invoke
  attempts against unregistered/untrusted tools, repeated RBAC denials for
  a role/tool pair, and critical-risk tool usage. Everything except the
  quarantine state itself is recomputed on every load, nothing extra
  stored.
- **LLM Caching -> Cache Dashboard** - tokens saved, estimated cost saved,
  hit rate and latency avoided; hits-vs-provider-calls over the last 12
  hours; how requests were resolved (exact / semantic / provider call /
  bypassed / error); savings broken down by provider and model; the cache
  contents with each entry's live policy verdict; and the recent cache
  event stream.
- **LLM Caching -> Providers & Policy** - pick Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini
  and a model, tune exact/semantic matching, configure every invalidation
  rule, and send a test completion to watch a miss turn into a hit. See
  [LLM caching for agents](#llm-caching-for-agents).
- **Audit Log** - every discover/invoke/authenticate decision, live-
  refreshing, filterable by action and decision.
- **Agent Tool Audit** - paste in a role's API key and call `discover`/`invoke`
  directly (no LLM in the loop) to see exactly what the RBAC + vector
  pre-filter returns. Try `shadow-diagnostics::run_diagnostic` as a tool
  ID in the Invoke panel - it's intentionally never registered, so it's
  denied no matter which role you use.
- **Tools -> Developer SDK** - install guide and quickstart for the official
  Python client (`aom_sdk`) - discover/invoke, cached completions, agent
  memory, and MCP tool integration - plus download buttons for the SDK
  itself and for AI-assistant integration skills (Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini).
  See [Developer SDK](#developer-sdk) below.

## MCP Tool Hijacking detection

MCP Tool Hijacking - usually delivered as a Tool Poisoning Attack - is an
indirect prompt injection vulnerability that's structural to MCP, not a
bug in any one server: an LLM ingests tool *descriptions* and tool *call
results* into the same trusted working context it reasons over, with no
built-in way to tell "text from a vetted source" apart from "text from
anywhere." A hidden instruction in one tool's metadata or output can
shadow, override, or redirect execution toward a completely different,
higher-privilege tool - data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and
silent execution (especially under an "always allow" auto-approval
config) are the usual payoffs. RBAC and server-trust review, on their
own, only stop tools that were never registered in the first place; they
don't catch a tool that looked fine at review time and was compromised
afterward, or a clean tool whose live response is what's actually
poisoned. This appliance runs three complementary defenses for that
(`operations-manager/app/hijack_detection.py`):

1. **Metadata poisoning**, caught at ingest time. Every tool's name,
   description, and input-schema property descriptions are scanned
   against a pattern bank (instruction-override language, covert/silent-
   execution cues, data-exfiltration cues, hidden-content markers like
   HTML comments or zero-width characters, and privilege-escalation
   language) the moment it's ingested. A match quarantines the tool
   immediately - `trust_status` is forced to `quarantined`, which the
   RBAC + vector Search pre-filter already excludes, the same way an
   untrusted server's tools are excluded. It's never discoverable or
   invokable by any role until released from the Threat Detection page.
2. **Response payload poisoning**, caught live. A tool's description can
   be completely clean and still return a poisoned payload at call time -
   a compromised web page, a tampered ticket body. That can't be caught
   at ingest because it doesn't exist yet, so every successful `invoke`
   response is scanned instead. A match doesn't withhold the response
   (the same words that flag an attack show up in a lot of harmless data
   too), but it's logged loudly: flagged on that audit-log entry and
   surfaced on Threat Detection and Insights.
3. **Cross-tool hijack chains**, the actual mechanism the first two
   defenses exist to catch in the act: a response-poisoning-flagged
   invoke by some caller, followed within `HIJACK_CHAIN_WINDOW_SECONDS`
   (default 120s) by that same caller invoking a materially higher-risk
   tool, is exactly the shape a successful hijack takes - the poisoned
   response steering the next tool call. This is a timing correlation
   over the audit log, not a confirmed compromise, so it's surfaced as a
   lead to investigate rather than an automatic block.

A background monitor also re-scans every already-ingested tool's stored
description against the current pattern bank on a timer
(`HIJACK_SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, default 5) with no MCP round-trip - this
is what catches a tool that was ingested before hijack detection existed,
or before a pattern-bank update, without hammering downstream MCP
servers to do it. A manual release or quarantine from the Threat
Detection or Tool Catalog page is remembered (`hijack_manual_override`)
so the next scan pass doesn't silently revert an admin's decision.

**Try it**: `docs-search::search_docs` (a registered, trusted sample
server) is quarantined automatically the moment it's ingested - open the
Threat Detection page to see why, and Release it to confirm it becomes
invokable again. `web-search::fetch_page` ingests and invokes completely
normally - its description is clean - but its mock response is poisoned;
invoke it from the Agent Tool Audit as any role, then invoke
`snowflake::manage_users` shortly after as `admin`, and watch a critical
cross-tool hijack chain finding appear on Insights and Threat Detection.

## LLM caching for agents

The same argument as the tool gateway, applied to model calls: an agent
that routes its completions through one governed choke point gets policy,
an audit trail - and a cache. Point an agent at `POST /v1/llm/complete`
with the API key it already uses for tool discovery and the operations
manager answers from Couchbase whenever it can, so the tokens are never
spent at all.

### Choosing the LLM

Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini are all selectable from **LLM Caching ->
Providers & Policy**, each with its own model list and list-price
estimates (`operations-manager/app/llm_cache.py`). Set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` to
proxy calls for real.

**No key is required to try it.** A provider with no key configured
answers a cache miss from a clearly-labelled deterministic stub, so
caching, savings accounting and invalidation all behave identically with
no outbound network access - the same "works on first boot" posture as the
bundled sample MCP servers. A key that *is* configured and then fails
raises, rather than silently writing fabricated text into the cache.

### How a prompt matches

1. **Exact** - SHA-256 of the normalized prompt (whitespace collapsed,
   case-folded) plus provider, model, namespace, scope and parameters.
   Resolved with a single KV get on a deterministic document ID.
2. **Semantic** - the fallback that catches paraphrases, reusing the
   catalog's own pattern: a Couchbase Search request combining vector kNN
   over the prompt embedding with a Conjunction pre-filter on provider,
   model, scope and namespace, so an entry belonging to another model or
   another tenant can never be returned however similar the prompt.
   Anything below the configured similarity threshold is a miss.

### Cache invalidation

Everything below is configurable during setup, evaluated by one function
(`llm_cache.evaluate_entry`) that the read path, the background sweeper
and the Cache Entries table all share - so what the UI shows and what the
gateway does cannot drift apart.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **TTL** | Written as a Couchbase document expiry *and* checked on read, so the cluster reclaims space even if the sweeper never runs. |
| **Stale-while-revalidate** | Grace window after the TTL during which a past-due answer is still served. |
| **Max entries + eviction policy** | LRU, LFU or FIFO once the cache is full. |
| **Max reuses per entry** | Retire an answer after N hits so a hot prompt is periodically re-verified against the provider. |
| **On model change** | Drop answers produced by the previously selected model. Entries created by an explicit per-request override are kept. |
| **On policy change** | Drop everything when a setting that changes what an answer *means* moves - namespace, cache scope, similarity threshold, generation parameters. |
| **On catalog change** | Drop everything when the vetted tool catalog changes, since an agent's answer can depend on which tools it was allowed to see. |
| **Cache scope** | `global`, `per_role` or `per_subject` - trade hit rate for isolation. |
| **Namespace** | A soft invalidation lever: bump it (after a prompt-template change, say) and older entries stop matching without deleting anything. |
| **Never-cache rules** | Regex patterns for time-sensitive prompts, plus RBAC roles that always bypass the cache. |
| **Manual purge** | Everything, or narrowed to one provider, model or namespace. |

A background sweeper applies the rules on a timer to entries nobody reads;
a read that notices a stale entry deletes it on the spot; and saving a
policy that invalidates runs the sweep immediately, so the setup page
reports what it just invalidated.

### Calling it

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/v1/llm/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-admin-4c56" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Summarise the RBAC model in three sentences."}'
```

The response carries the answer plus `cache.status`
(`hit_exact` / `hit_semantic` / `miss` / `bypass`), the similarity that
earned a semantic hit, token usage, and what the hit saved. Send the same
prompt twice to watch the second one cost nothing. `provider` and `model`
can be overridden per request; `bypass_cache: true` forces a live call.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/llm/providers` | Selectable LLMs, their models and pricing, and which have a key configured (never the key). |
| `GET` / `PUT /v1/llm/config` | Read and save the cache policy. Every value is re-validated server-side. |
| `POST /v1/llm/complete` | The caching gateway. Authenticated exactly like discover/invoke. |
| `GET /v1/llm/dashboard` | Savings, hit rate, hourly series and per-model breakdown. |
| `GET /v1/llm/cache` | Cache contents with each entry's live policy verdict. |
| `POST /v1/llm/cache/purge` | Manual invalidation, optionally filtered. |
| `POST /v1/llm/cache/sweep` | Run the invalidation sweeper now. |
| `DELETE /v1/llm/cache/{entry_id}` | Invalidate one entry. |

## Developer SDK

A typed Python client (`aom_sdk`) for the discover / invoke / complete /
memory gateway ships with this appliance, so integrating an agent doesn't
mean hand-rolling bearer headers and JSON payloads against the raw REST
API. Get it from **Tools -> Developer SDK** in the dashboard - the page
has the full install guide, a quickstart, and a Download SDK button - or
from `operations-manager/sdk/` directly in this repo. The download is
built fresh from that source on every request (`GET /v1/sdk/download`),
so it always matches the API this appliance is actually running.

```python
from aom_sdk import AOMClient

client = AOMClient("https://localhost:8090", api_key="demo-support-agent-9f21", verify=False)

discovered = client.discover("look up a customer's open support tickets")
result = client.invoke(discovered["tools"][0]["tool_id"], arguments={})

answer = client.complete("Summarize this ticket thread in two sentences.")
print(answer["response"], answer["cache"]["status"])

client.add_memory("user-42", "Prefers responses in metric units.", memory_type="profile")
relevant = client.search_memory("user-42", "does this user use metric or imperial?")
```

Non-2xx responses raise typed exceptions (`AOMAuthenticationError`,
`AOMAuthorizationError`, `AOMNotFoundError`, `AOMServerError`,
`AOMConnectionError`) instead of a bare HTTP status code. See
`operations-manager/sdk/README.md` and the bundled `examples/` for the
rest, including a worked example of the LLM-caching cost/latency savings
described above at agent-fleet scale.

### Agent memory

Durable, cross-session recall stored in the same Couchbase cluster as
everything else in this appliance (`agent_memory` collection + its own
Search vector index) - not a separate service to run. `POST /v1/memory`
embeds and stores an entry scoped to a `user_id` (and optionally a
`session_id`/`memory_type`); `POST /v1/memory/search` recalls the entries
closest in meaning to a new query, the same RBAC-free vector-search
pattern `discover_tools()` runs over the tool catalog. `GET /v1/memory`,
`DELETE /v1/memory/{memory_id}` and `POST /v1/memory/clear` round out the
surface. All four authenticate exactly like discover/invoke/complete.

### MCP tool integration

AOM already speaks MCP to every downstream tool server it proxies to (see
`operations-manager/app/mcp_client.py`); the SDK makes that protocol
visible on the client side too: `client.discover_mcp_tools(query)` returns
matched tools already converted to standard MCP tool definitions
(`{"name", "description", "inputSchema"}`), and the optional
`aom_sdk.mcp_server` bridge (`pip install "couchbase-aom-sdk[mcp]"`) runs
this appliance as a real local MCP server over stdio, so any MCP host can
attach to it directly - still governed by AOM's RBAC and audit trail.

### AI assistant integration skills

The same integration knowledge as the guide above, packaged so a coding
assistant can apply it to a codebase directly: a real Claude Skill
(`operations-manager/skills/claude/SKILL.md`), plus equivalent packages for
ChatGPT and Gemini (`operations-manager/skills/{chatgpt,gemini}/`) - those
two platforms have no single portable skill-file format, so they ship as
plain instructions text with a README on where to paste it (Custom GPT
instructions, an Assistants/Responses system message, an `AGENTS.md` file,
a `GEMINI.md` context file, or a Gem's instructions). All three download
from **Tools -> Developer SDK**, or `GET /v1/skills/{claude,chatgpt,gemini}/download`.

## Registering your own MCP servers

Point the Servers page (or `POST /v1/servers`) at any Streamable-HTTP MCP
endpoint your infrastructure runs. A server's tools are only ever ingested
if it's marked `trusted` - leave a newly-added server `untrusted` until
you've reviewed it, then flip it to trusted and hit Re-ingest.

```bash
# /v1/servers is part of the dashboard's admin surface, so this needs a
# logged-in session cookie (log in via /v1/auth/login and pass its
# Set-Cookie back with -b) - the payload shape below is what matters here.
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/v1/servers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{
        "server_id": "billing-service",
        "label": "Billing Service (Internal)",
        "owner": "Platform Team",
        "mcp_url": "http://billing-service.internal:9000/mcp",
        "trust_status": "trusted",
        "default_allowed_roles": ["admin"]
      }'
```

## Notes

- The bundled sample MCP servers return small, representative mock data -
  no real Jira/Zendesk/Snowflake credentials, and no real network access,
  are needed to try the appliance (or the hijacking-detection fixtures)
  out of the box.
- API keys in `.env.example` are placeholder values only - rotate them
  before exposing this appliance beyond your laptop.
- Audit log entries expire after `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS` (default 30
  days) via a Couchbase document TTL.
- LLM cache events expire after `LLM_CACHE_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS` (default
  30 days). The savings dashboard is computed from those events, so that
  setting is also how far back "tokens saved" can look.
- Cost figures on the LLM Caching dashboard are list-price estimates from
  the table in `operations-manager/app/llm_cache.py`, not billing data.
  Edit that table for your own negotiated rates.
- Caching is most defensible at temperature 0: a deterministic prompt
  should have a deterministic answer. The default policy sets it there.
- The hijack pattern bank is heuristic, not proof of malicious intent - it
  is deliberately tuned toward catching real attacks over avoiding every
  false positive, since the cost of a false positive is one click on
  Release and the cost of a false negative is a live prompt-injection
  payload sitting in the catalog unnoticed.
