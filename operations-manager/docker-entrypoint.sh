# persists across image rebuilds, so a key file left over from before
# this permission scheme existed - or written by an older image - won't
# get fixed just by rebuilding. Re-assert group-root-readable + 0640 on
# every startup (self-heals stale volumes) so nginx's root master
# process (which lost CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE under ui's cap_drop: [ALL]
# hardening in docker-compose.yml) can always read it. See
# _grant_group_root_read() in app/user_auth.py for the same fix applied
# whenever a certificate is installed/reverted at runtime.
