"""
Insights engine: turns the tool catalog, server registry, and recent audit
log into a list of findings the Dashboard and Insights page can render as
severity-tagged cards - the same "highest severity findings" pattern used
elsewhere in Couchbase's agent tooling, applied here to operations-manager
hygiene and security signal instead of query/index tuning.

Most findings here are *derived*, not stored - recomputed on each request
from whatever is currently in Couchbase, nothing to approve or apply. The
two hijack-detection finding types are the exception: a quarantined-tool
finding reflects a real, stored trust_status change (see
app/hijack_detection.py and the Threat Detection page's release/quarantine
actions), and a cross-tool hijack chain finding is a correlation over the
audit log, not something this module writes anywhere itself.
