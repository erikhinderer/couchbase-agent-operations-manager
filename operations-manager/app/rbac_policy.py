The seed RBAC policy for the Couchbase Agent Operations Manager.

This module is a *bootstrap*, not the runtime source of truth: it seeds
`ROLES`, three sample trusted servers, and their per-tool policy into
Couchbase on first boot (only if those documents don't already exist), so
the appliance is immediately testable. From then on, Couchbase's `servers`
and `tools` collections are authoritative - new servers registered through
the Servers page or `POST /v1/servers`, and roles assigned to them there,
persist independently of this file and survive a redeploy of this image.

ROLES stays code-defined because roles are the kind of thing a security
team reviews in a PR, not something end users add through a UI. Servers
and tool-level RBAC, by contrast, need to change without a redeploy - that
is what the dynamic registration API and Servers page are for.

SEED_SERVERS is the bundled sample MCP servers used for out-of-the-box
evaluation - jira/zendesk/snowflake (well-behaved), plus two fixtures for
MCP Tool Hijacking detection (see app/hijack_detection.py):
`docs-search`, whose one tool's *description* carries a metadata-poisoning
payload, and `web-search`, whose tool description is clean but whose
*response* carries one instead. Both are registered/trusted like any other
seed server - docs-search::search_docs gets auto-quarantined the moment
it's ingested (metadata poisoning is caught before a tool is ever
discoverable), while web-search::fetch_page ingests and invokes normally,
so its response only gets flagged live, the first time something actually
calls it - use it from the Agent Tool Audit to see a hijack finding appear in
real time. The bundled shadow-diagnostics server is a third, separate
fixture, intentionally left out of this map the same way any unreviewed,
unregistered MCP server would be: it never gets its tools ingested at all,
so it can never be discovered or invoked through this operations manager no
matter how well a query matches it semantically.
